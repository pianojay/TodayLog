opennav depends on F2C v1.2.1:
Fields2Cover
https://github.com/Fields2Cover/Fields2Cover/tree/v1.2.1

tag v1.2.1

Follow the Compilation procedure, as discussed here:
https://github.com/open-navigation/opennav_coverage/issues/58#issuecomment-2136548573
And the official document here:
https://github.com/Fields2Cover/Fields2Cover/tree/v1.2.1?tab=readme-ov-file#compilation
So you compile the Fields2Cover and again with colcon for ROS2 integration.
