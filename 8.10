I think I got a good "abstract" of how things are abstracted.
Now I have to connect the layers of abstraction:

The ROS2 Action invokes Nav2 BT with the behavior tree defined by my xml.
The BT then realizes appropriate nodes (ex: map, costmap, planner, smoother controller) with provided configuration for each Action Nodes. (ex: NavToPose, NavThroughPoses)
Then the nodes do the thing, orchestrated by the BT.
Now that's hierarchial abstraction:
ROS2 Action -> Root BT -> Action Node: Nav2 BT (NavToPose, NavThroughPoses) -> "planner, controller" Nav2 Nodes

And before everything, make sure to run Nav2 Bringup, including lifecycle node...
I think I understood the structure of Nav2 and the utilization of it clear.

Now I need to make this whole thing running. Like, it is not enough to understand them component-wise... Hopefully, it should be, but it is not that simple.

Please review my understanding here, and correct me if I am wrong.

ROS2 Action → Root BT → Nav2 BT Action Nodes → Nav2 Core Nodes
     ↑              ↑            ↑                    ↑
Your Mission    Your XML    Nav2 Primitives    Nav2 Services


1. Lifecycle Management
bash#
Nav2 nodes are lifecycle nodes - they need to be configured and activated
ros2 launch nav2_bringup navigation_launch.py

2. Configuration Chain

Each layer needs its config files
Parameters must be consistent across layers
Transform tree must be complete

3. Timing and Dependencies

Map server must be up before costmaps
Localization before navigation
All lifecycle nodes activated before BT starts

4. Integration Testing Approach
Bottom-up testing:

# 1. Test core nodes first
ros2 launch nav2_bringup navigation_launch.py
# 2. Test basic BT
ros2 action send_goal /navigate_to_pose nav2_msgs/action/NavigateToPose
# 3. Test your custom BT
# 4. Test your custom action server
