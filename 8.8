~/lidar 만듦..

Gazebo는 일단 건들지 않을 것임.
함수는 끝남.
Map 관련해서는 depth cam -> traversability 받는 거가 남아있긴 한데 일단은 다른 거 하고 싶음.

오늘은 Groot 및 Behavior Tree를 공부해 보자. Groot는 나다.
Groot는 BehaviorTree.CPP의 BT를 쉽게 수정할 수 있는 프로그램이다. 그러면 머리가 덜 아프다. 야호

BT V4를 위해서는 Groot2를 설치해야 한다.

1. Each node acts as a cellular automaton.
2. Each nodes are connected to form a tree.
3. A node will have a parent except root.
4. A node can receive a tick from its parent. It sends tick to it children in order. children can give RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILURE when it receives a tick which can change internal state of the node. The node then report either RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILURE to its parent depending on its defined behavior.
5. Nodes without children will be a LeafNode. They will be either Action (actuator) node or Condition (percept or internal state) node. Condition node cannot return RUNNING, as it acts as a buffer.
6. Here, no information travels which is not a tick, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILURE.

So we need Blackboard or ROS topic/service/action for "global" info transfer.

Blackboards are also called as "port"

Nav2 plugin Nodes:
https://docs.nav2.org/behavior_trees/overview/nav2_specific_nodes.html
https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/tree/humble/nav2_behavior_tree/plugins

1. Action Nodes, Condition Nodes ... (the leaf nodes, so the nodes that interact)
There are a lot, including:
action:		ComputePathToPose, FollowPath, Spin, Wait, Backup, ClearCostmapService
condition:	GoalUpdated, GoalReached, InitialPoseReceived, isBatteryLow

2. Decorator Nodes:
Distance Controller	Will tick children nodes every time the robot has traveled a certain distance
Rate Controller		Controls the ticking of its child node at a constant frequency. The tick rate is an exposed port
Goal Updater		Will update the goal of children nodes via ports on the BT
Single Trigger		Will only tick its child node once, and will return FAILURE for all subsequent ticks
Speed Controller	Controls the ticking of its child node at a rate proportional to the robot’s speed

3. Control Nodes:
Defaults:
Fallback
ReactiveFallback
Sequence
ReactiveSequence
SequenceWithMemory

Nav2:

PipelineSequence: Sequence but pipelined, so that each child end up reporting "SUCCESS" at least once (if FAIURE then interrupt as is)
Recovery: Two children; one for main, one for recovery; If something fails, try recovery and resume.
RoundRobin: Round robin the children until one give SUCCESS, then SUCCESS. If every node give FAILURE, then FAILURE.

(the following is not added in humble branch?? this is confusing...)
NonblockingSequence: PipelineSequence but every node has to end up reporting "RUNNING" and "SUCCESS" at all times.
PersistentSequence: PipelineSequence but with waiting, using blackboard to store data
PauseResumeController: Using service calls, add pause and resume.


Now let's check what we can do and see.
