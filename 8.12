For example

[ Mission Action Server ]
        |
        |--- "gnss_only": Convert WGS84 to ENU, send Nav2 NavigateToPose goal (BT override: gnss_only.xml)
        |
        |--- "cover_vision": 
                1. Convert WGS84 center to ENU
                2. Generate coverage waypoints (radius)
                3. Send Nav2 NavigateThroughPoses goal (BT override: cover_vision.xml)
                4. BT monitors OpenCV detection condition
                5. On detection, send new NavigateToPose to object position


Coverage: Radial L-shape search algorithm
